# Codeforces_scrapper
Using the scrapper:

When you run the script , a gui window should open up asking for the codeforces handle. If you enter a non-existent handle, or a handle which hasn't participated in any competitions yet (thus lacking certain data fields like max rating etc) an error box will pop up.
If you are unsure of a handle, try 'DmitriyH'
A new window should open with all the details about that user.
